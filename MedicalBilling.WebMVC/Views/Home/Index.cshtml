    <h3>ICD-10 INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>
        ICD (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health problems) is now on its 10th revision. ICD-10 codes are the byproduct of that revision.
        This medical classification list is generated by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is used to help healthcare providers identify and code health conditions.
    <p>

    <p>ICD-10 is required for use by physicians and healthcare providers under the Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) and will replace all ICD-9 code sets.</p>

    <p>
        Many more new diagnoses can be tracked using ICD-10 than with ICD-9. Some expanded code sets, like ICD-10-CM, have over 70,000 codes.
